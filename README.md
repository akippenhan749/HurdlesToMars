# Hurdles to Mars

This is a journal project investigating some of the major hurdles to overcome in order to make a crewed mission to Mars possible. My team and I researched four of what we believed to be some of the most significant hurdles and compiled this project to discuss each one and what could be done to overcome it. This repository contains two scripts, `deployApp.sh` ([src](deployApp.sh)) and `deployApp.R` ([src](deployApp.R)), which are used for adding a deployment timestamp to the project and running the application deployment process. The journal article is contained in `HurdlesToMars.Rmd` ([src](HurdlesToMars.Rmd)), which uses the open source Bootswatch theme, [Solar](https://bootswatch.com/solar). The images used in the document can be found in the `images` folder of this repository.

This project was created with a team of three other undergraduate students as part of the Mission to Mars (ASTR 3450) course at the University of Virginia in the Spring of 2023. A published version of this project is hosted as a Shiny app on the shinyapps.io cloud platform and can be found [here](https://akippenhan.shinyapps.io/HurdlesToMars).
